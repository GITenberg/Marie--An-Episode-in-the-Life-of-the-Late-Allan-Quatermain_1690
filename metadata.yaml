description: "Marie is a 1912 novel by H. Rider Haggard featuring Allan Quatermain.\
  \ The plot concerns Quatermain as a young man and involves his first marriage, to\
  \ the Boer farm girl, Marie Marais. Their romance is opposed by Marie's anti-English\
  \ father, and the villainous Pereira, who desires Marie. They are Voortrekkers who\
  \ take part in the Great Trek whom Quatermain has to rescue.\nThe novel describes\
  \ Quatermain's involvement in the Sixth Xhosa War of 1835 and Weenen massacre. Real\
  \ life people such as Piet Retief, Thomas Halstead, and the Zulu chief Dingane appear\
  \ as characters. Events in Nada the Lily are frequently referred to.\n\n\n From\
